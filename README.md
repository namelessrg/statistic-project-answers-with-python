The aim of this project is to let you exercise what we have learned in the lectures with Python libraries.
Please, provide an “ipynb” file, created with Jupyter notebook.
1) Download the excel file “Employee_Data” provided at atlas.edubiz course page.
2) Read it with pandas library to create a data frame.
3) Print out the mean and the standard deviation of all the salary data.
4) Create a scatter plot for the salary data where the x axis is the index of the employee.
5) Create a histogram plot or count plot showing the number of employees hired at each year. If you
use histogram plot, it must have the number of bins so that each bin corresponds to a single year.
(You should determine it by experiment. Also, you should be able to extract the year from the hire
date. Google it).
6) Create a histogram plot or count plot showing the number of employees according to their ages. If
you use histogram plot, it must have the number of bins so that each bin corresponds to a single
age.
7) Create a box plot for all the salary data.
8) Create two separate box plots side by side for the salary data of males and females.
9) Create a strip plot side by side for the salary data of males and females.
10)Create a swarm plot side by side for the salary data of males and females.
11)Create a count plot showing the number of employees belonging to each ethnicity.
12) Print out the mean and the standard deviation of the salary data belonging to each ethnicity.
13)Create a count plot showing the number of employees belonging to each country.
14) Print out the mean and the standard deviation of the salary data belonging to each country.
15)Create a count plot showing the number of employees belonging to each department.
16) Print out the mean and the standard deviation of the salary data belonging to each department.
17)Randomly sample 100 employees and print the mean and the standard deviation of the salary
data (Google the random sampling, there is a simple way).
18) Perform the previous operation 10,000 times and create a histogram plot for the distribution of the
mean. See that it is approximately normally distributed, and the standard deviation is 0.1 times the
original standard deviation you computed at step 3.
19) Add a new row to the end of the file with an employee data of your own choice.
20)Delete the Exit Date and the Bonus columns of the excel file and save it as
“Employee_Data_Update”.
